# MyFirstRepo
# README

This repository serves as a practice space for learning and applying GitHub skills. It contains simple exercises and files that help me understand how to create, edit, and manage repositories effectively.

The purpose of this repository is to practice version control and get familiar with GitHub workflows. This is my first repository created as part of a GitHub learning task, and it allows me to gain hands-on experience in creating files, committing changes, and organizing my projects efficiently.
